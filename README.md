### Curse Scraper

This project aims to scrape some mod specific data off the curseforge website that doesn't seem to be available through the API. For most stats, [CurseMeta](https://github.com/dries007/CurseMeta) is better.

At the moment this is still WIP (see the horrendous code structure, TODOs, etc). However, I hope to get this into a clean and usable state soon.
